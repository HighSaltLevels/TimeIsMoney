# TimeIsMoney

This is a simple GUI application I made in python during my internships at Honeywell. Since me and the other interns were being paid hourly, I thought it would be a good idea to make a program that counts up how much money you are making in real time. Just enter your payrate in the box and click "Clock In". It's a huge motivator to see how much money you accumulated at the end of the day.
